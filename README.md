# BBC-Game-Of-Life

This is my attempt at Conway’s Game of Life, created in Python. Before I was given this task I had no experience in coding Python. Now that I have attempted this task, I have some knowledge of the Python coding language. I chose Python as it is stated as being “easy to learn”, over other programming languages, such as PHP.

Attached in this file are the files given to me by the BBC, which I have commented, as well as a template of the working coding structure, of which I have edited and commented, and finally my own sudocoded structure.

Before I started this task I relied heavily on tutorial and online resources, see below for reference:
